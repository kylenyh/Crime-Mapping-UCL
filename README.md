# Crime-Mapping

This module will equip students with the theoretical and practical knowledge of crime mapping. It will cover principles that are specific to the analysis of geographical information and provide students with foundational Geographic Information System (GIS) skills. Particular attention will be paid to the strengths and weaknesses of different types of mapping techniques and cartographic skills. At the end of the module students should be able to competently generate a range of crime maps and understand the benefits and limitations of doing so.

Teaching time for this module is primarily devoted to hands-on practical computer workshops. There is an expectation that students will prepare for these workshops in advance by engaging with the teaching materials. Weekly Moodle quizzes contribute to half of the marks for this module, with coursework making up the remaining marks.
